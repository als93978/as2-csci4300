1. When the window is a smaller height than 1080 (like on a usual 1920x1080 screen),
   the footer and the bottom "SIGN UP" button collide. This is on desktop, not mobile.
   - This can probably be lumped into an overall Responsive Web Design issue. The website
   needs to be much more responsive.
   - Priority: Medium High

2. Multiple positioning and alignment issues exist for mobile.
   - Again, this is a Responsive Web Design issue.
   - Mobile support was not mentioned in the PDF file, however, so I assume it is a
   lower priority for this project, if we are even required to support it at all.
   - But, mobile has a large number of users and is growing fast. Supporting it
   would be nice and a good learning experience if we have time.
   - Priority: Low

3. Focus Outlining issues
   - I don't want to completely get rid out of focus outlines because
   that would make the website unusable for disabled keyboard users.
   - Unfortuntely, the current focus outlines (red boxes) that I specified
   in CSS don't look so good sometimes.
   - This is especially true with the search bars (which have white outlines).
   In Firefox, the outline is shown only on the left side of the search bar and
   it looks completely fine.
   In Chrome, the outline is shown on all sides except the right side because of
   the search button "inside of" or right next to the search bar.
   - Priority: High
   - IS FIXED (MOSTLY?), BUT SOME TWEAKS MIGHT NEED TO BE DONE LATER
